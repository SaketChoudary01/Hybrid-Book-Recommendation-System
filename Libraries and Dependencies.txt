Libraries and Dependencies
This project relies on the following libraries:

NumPy: For numerical computations and linear algebra operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering.
Surprise: For matrix factorization (Singular Value Decomposition - SVD) and recommendation system utilities.
Warnings: To suppress unnecessary warnings during execution.
What Has Been Done
Data Preparation: Loaded datasets (Books.csv, Users.csv, Ratings.csv) for books, users, and their ratings.
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and merged datasets into a single dataframe.
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features and created a pivot table for the user-item matrix.
Modeling:
Implemented a hybrid recommendation model combining Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity) and SVD.
Evaluated the model with metrics like RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, and Recall@K.
Visualization: Used heatmaps and scatter plots to represent rating distributions and model performance.
Execution Steps
Install the required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-surprise

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory.
Place the datasets (Books.csv, Users.csv, Ratings.csv) in the working directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (DAA_Book_Recommendation_System.ipynb) in an environment like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results and visualize the findings.

To-Do for Execution
Ensure the datasets (Books.csv, Users.csv, Ratings.csv) are available in the specified paths.
Verify that all dependencies are installed and compatible with the Python version in use.
Adjust paths and environment-specific settings (e.g., Colab's file paths) if necessary.
