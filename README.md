# Hybrid Book Recommendation System

This project presents a **Hybrid Book Recommendation System** that combines **Cosine Similarity** and **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** to deliver personalized and highly accurate book recommendations. It addresses key challenges like data sparsity and scalability, making it a robust solution for modern recommendation systems.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based filtering (Cosine Similarity) with collaborative filtering (SVD).
- **Precision and Recall**: Achieves a precision score of 0.80 and recall of 0.60, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently.
- **User-Centric**: Tailors recommendations based on user preferences and book attributes.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Employs RMSE, MAE, NMAE, precision, and recall for performance analysis.

## Dataset
The datasets used include:
1. **Books.csv**: Contains book metadata (ISBN, title, author, publisher, etc.).
2. **Ratings.csv**: Includes user ratings for books.
3. **Users.csv**: Contains anonymized user demographics (age, location).

## Results
The hybrid model outperforms traditional recommendation techniques:
- **MAE**: 0.6747
- **RMSE**: 0.5035
- **Precision at K**: 0.80
- **Recall at K**: 0.60

The system demonstrated significant accuracy and reliability in generating book recommendations compared to earlier models.

## Why Itâ€™s Better
- **Data Sparsity**: SVD effectively estimates missing values, overcoming sparse data challenges.
- **Customizability**: Adapts to both user preferences and item similarity, enhancing personalization.
- **Benchmarking**: Outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in metrics like MAE, RMSE, and precision.
